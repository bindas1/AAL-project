About us
We are third year Computer Science students at Warsaw University of Technology. 
This is our project for the course called Machine learning engineering. 
We are both interested in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science, since we put a lot of time and effort into this project. 
You can find us on LinkedIn: [Aleksandra Kukawka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandrakukawka/) and [Bart≈Çomiej Binda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bart%C5%82omiej-binda-936915147/).
